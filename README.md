# Accessibility Theme Builder
![logo](./_images/tb-logo-sm.png) A system for generating machine readable asset types allowing design systems to publish products that are accessibly inclusive.

### Concept
Accessibility compliance is difficult. All too often accessibility is addressed late in the development and testing cycle. What if systems were designed upfront with accessible inclusion as a design principle? What the workflow between designers and developers produced accessible components before teh assembling of applications?

Adhering to an [Atomic Accessibility Design Methodology](https://discoverfinancial.github.io/a11y-theme-builder/motivation/solution/), the *Accessibility Theme Builder* enables designers to systematically achieve consistent standards compliance. The system collects atomic design system variables, allowing a *Designer* to incrementally create asset types (JSON, CSS files) that can be used to:

1. publish physical and digital solutions
2. generate reusable design components that are leveraged to build physical and digital solutions
