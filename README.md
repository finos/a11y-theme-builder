# Accessibility Theme Builder

![logo](./_images/tb-logo-sm.png) A system for generating machine readable asset types allowing design systems to publish products that are accessibly inclusive.

### Concept

Accessibility compliance is difficult. All too often accessibility is addressed late in the development and testing cycle. What if systems were designed upfront with accessible inclusion as a design principle? What if the workflow between designers and developers produced accessible components before the assembling of applications?

![workflow](./_images/gaad-a11y-e2e.png)

Adhering to an [Atomic Accessibility Design Methodology](https://finos.github.io/a11y-theme-builder/motivation/solution/), the *Accessibility Theme Builder* enables designers to systematically achieve consistent standards compliance. The system collects atomic design system variables, allowing a *Designer* to incrementally create asset types (JSON, CSS files) that can be used to:

1. publish physical and digital solutions
2. generate reusable design components that are leveraged to build physical and digital solutions
