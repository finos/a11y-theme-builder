## Use Cases
Share an idea for how the theme builder can be used. We are interested in all possible use cases (not limited to Finance Sector). Are you interested in building a prototype for a use case? Explore and/or augment this list of use cases. Please use an [existing or new ticket](https://github.com/discoverfinancial/a11y-theme-builder/issues) to expand on a specific use case. 

| Feature Name | Description | Suggestion Ticket |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Workflow Integrations 

Do you have an idea for how the theme builder can be used in the workflow activities between accessibility designers, developers, and testers? Are you interested in doing a proof-of-concept for a end-to-end integration? Explore and/or augment this list of ideas. Please use an [existing or new ticket](https://github.com/discoverfinancial/a11y-theme-builder/issues) to expand on a specific concept. 

| Concept | Description |Suggestion Ticket |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Theme Switcher |Utilize the theme builder to switch been themes for a given interface. Examples include upgrading a design system theme from WCAG AA to AAA. | |
