| Customized Consumer Instruments | Customized credit cards or mail based on a user’s preferences (for example: if a user note they were colorblind, theme builder tool would be utilized to automatically change the colors & contrast values of their credit card). | |
| CLI | A CLI could be used in a CI/CD process to automate any of the following: (1) transformation: automatically building/deploying multiple versions of a single app with different accessibility features enabled.(2) verification: verify that the checked in design system meets the min level of the source control merging standards; (3) output generation: automatically generate the outputs (CSS, JSON, PPT, etc) from a hosted design system. | |  

## Workflow Integrations 

Do you have an idea for how the theme builder can be used in the workflow activities between accessibility designers, developers, and testers? Are you interested in doing a proof-of-concept for a end-to-end integration? Explore and/or augment this list of ideas. Please use an [existing or new ticket](https://github.com/discoverfinancial/a11y-theme-builder/issues) to expand on a specific concept. 

| Concept | Description |Suggestion Ticket |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Low-code Environment Integration using [airplane.dev](https://www.airplane.dev/) | Imagine a simple easy to use toolchain workflow whereby the Theme Builder provides the accessibly aware CSS that can be consumed by a low-code developer environment. | [214](https://github.com/discoverfinancial/a11y-theme-builder/issues/214) |
| Dynamic Github A11y | Create your personalized A11y Theme and connect it to Github account for a personalized experience. | [312](https://github.com/discoverfinancial/a11y-theme-builder/issues/312) |
| Theme Switcher |Utilize the theme builder to switch been themes for a given interface. Examples include upgrading a design system theme from WCAG AA to AAA. | |
| Compliance Testing| Test prototypes & solutions developed utilizing [Fable testing tool](https://makeitfable.com/). This would include adding a sample app that can be used for applying themes and then testing for verifying compliance. | |
| Restaurant Menu Generator | Integrate theme builder into menu creation at restaurants. Once a user scans the QR code for a menu, they would be able to switch to different themes of the menu, depending on their disability. | |
