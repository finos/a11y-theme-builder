# Developers Intro

This section seeks to introduce information that can be used to enhance and extend the Theme Builder tool.  Topics such as how to add atomic elements (atoms, molecules, organisms) to the tool will support the effort to keep the tool current with emerging web or mobile UI components.  The ability to add more accessibility layers will allow applications to be even more inclusive.  And Theme Builder could also support other types of storage, other output formtats, and other modes.

We recommend starting with the code walkthrough and branching out from there.  If you would like to contribute to this project, please see the [contributor's guide](https://github.com/discoverfinancial/a11y-theme-builder/blob/main/CONTRIBUTE.md) for information on how to begin engaging with the community
