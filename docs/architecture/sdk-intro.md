# Understanding the SDK

The SDK provides APIs which make it easy to generate accessible themes.

In particular, the SDK provides the following:

* APIs for creating, modifying, and deleting themes;
* calculations that are necessary to ensure that accessibility requirements are met;
* a pluggable persistent interface;
* code generation for CSS and JSON (Figma-compliant); and
* extensibility with regard to atoms, molecules, organisms, and accessibility layers.

## SDK Tutorial

The best way to learn how to use the SDK APIs directly is to use the [SDK Tutorial](https://github.com/discoverfinancial/a11y-theme-builder-sdk/blob/main/TUTORIAL.md#accessibility-theme-builder-sdk-tutorial).  This tutorial provides specific examples of how to use the APIs for the most common tasks, in the order in which you will typically perform these tasks.

## SDK Reference API documentation

In addition, for more detailed information, you may [visit the online SDK API docs](https://discoverfinancial.github.io/a11y-theme-builder-sdk/modules.html) which are generated using [TypeDoc](TypeDoc) and provide reference documentation for each of the APIs provided by the SDK.
