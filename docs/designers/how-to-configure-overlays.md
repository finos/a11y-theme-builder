The Theme Builder provides a plug-able architecture based on the layers which allow customized user preferences to be applied to design components.

Custom `overlays` can be developed to address a wide range of disabilities. Initially, the Theme Builder includes overlays for several accessibility preferences:

* Dyslexic preferences
* Motion sensitivity preferences
* Color blind preferences

However, at this juncture this list needs to be expanded and the functionality of the initial overlays is incomplete.
