# Workflow Guidance
Imagine the possibilities for how the *Theme Builder* could be used or extended. 

We have established this section in our documentation dedicated to providing guidance on how current and/or future features could be put to use. 

Learn how to accomplish specific tasks for *Designers* and *Developers*. 

Explore how community members have used the tool.

Join us in the ongoing effort to document new and exciting integrated workflows. 

In this section you will find:

* answers to existing scenarios
* suggestions for scenarios that need guidance
* calls for new scenario ideas

Remember, if you are interested in helping us enhance this tool, please join the project and see our [call for contributors](../contribute/index.md).
