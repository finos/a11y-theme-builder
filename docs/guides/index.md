# Workflow Guidance
Imagine the possibilities!  How many ways could the *Theme Builder* application be used or extended?

We have dedicated this section in our documentation to providing guidance on how current and/or future features could be put to use.  As you read these guides you will learn how to accomplish specific tasks for *Designers* and *Developers* and explore how community members have used the tool.  Please join us in this ongoing effort to create more guides, documenting new and exciting integrated workflows.

In this section you will find:

* answers to existing scenarios
* suggestions for scenarios that need community input and guidance
* calls for new scenario ideas

Remember, if you are interested in helping us enhance this tool, please join the project and see our [call for contributors](../contribute/index.md).
