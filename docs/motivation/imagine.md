Since [Atomic Design](./methodology.md) enables designers and developers to establish a round-trip workflow process that traverses from abstract concepts to concrete details; and given the challenges associated with risk compliance for people with disabilities (Visual, Motion, Motor, Auditory, Cognitive/Learning), **what if**:

* We applied *Atomic Design* concepts towards the development of accessibly compliant solutions yields consistency and scalability while mitigating regulatory risk. 
* An atomic design system could allow us to apply reuse, scale, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery in the creation of user experiences?
* We had design and development libraries that were consistent to each other.  If changes happened in one they would be pushed to the other?
* We could create an atomic design system that was rooted in accessibility, assuring all components met accessibility guidelines?
* We could update atomic elements and roll changes across all products in minutes rather than months or years?
* We could align desktop and mobile experiences?
* We could seamlessly deliver light and dark mode experiences that meet WCAG guidelines?
* We could provide on-demand profile aware experiences that addressed a user's specific accessibility needs?
