### Contributing Code

#### Community Adoption
Strategically, *Discover Financial Services* intends for this repository to be **promoted** for maturation upstream within a *yet-to-be-identified* community such as [FINOS](https://www.finos.org), [The A11y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com), or [OpenJS](https://openjsf.org). Once we see broader community contributions we will aggressively work towards that the promoting of this project. If and when such a transfer occurs, normal `pull request` based contributions will be possible. 

#### Incubation Period
For the tactical timeframe (*for as long as this repo resided within the [DFS GitHub organization](https://github.com/discoverfinancial)*), `pull request` will not be accepted. For those willing to 
answer our [call for contributions](https://discoverfinancial.github.io/a11y-theme-builder/contribute/), please proceed by:

1. 'forking` one of the project repositories
2. Developing a contribution within your forked repo
3. Opening an [issue or feature enhancement report](https://github.com/discoverfinancial/a11y-theme-builder/issues) where a redirect to the new contribution (forked repo) is captured.
4. Add the GitHub Topic `a11y-tb` to your forked repo for that we can query all of GitHub for available features and fixes to import.

## Translations
Our project aspires to be globally applicable but that requires internationalization support beyond the English language. We seek help in:

* Providing instructions for extending internationalization support;
* Providing specific language translation enhancements.
