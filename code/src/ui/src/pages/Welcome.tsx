                This tool was created to help teams quickly create a robust and accessible
                Unified Design System that supports light and dark mode, desktop and mobile applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, for each system we will provide a dylexic theme,
                a non-animated theme (for folks with motion sensitivities)
                and a color blind theme.  &nbsp;
                <a onClick={() => setInclusiveIsOpen(true)} >Learn more</a>
                &nbsp; about our inclusive themes.

            <p>
                A Unified Design System is made up of a core Figma Design Library
                and paired with a complementing and consistent core CSS and core React Component Library.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Theme Builder give you the power to customize the Design System and the foundational JSON.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using GitHub the JSON that feeds these core systems keeps everythiung synchronized.
